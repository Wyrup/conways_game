\section{Problem statement}
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton simulation, our goal is to develop it following those constraints :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each cell is a different Elixir process
    \item The cells should communicate exchanging messages
    \item At least two BEAM VMs have to be used to demonstrate ???
    \item A visualization using the terminal to showcase the program running 
\end{itemize}
Those constraints will compel us to use some new technologies for us like GenServer and Supervisor.

\section{State-of-the-art}
The state-of-the-art in distributed cellular automata simulations, such as Conway's Game of Life, leverages Elixir's concurrency model for scalable, fault-tolerant implementations. Elixir projects typically package simulations as Mix applications, utilizing GenServer for cell processes that manage state and message-passing for neighbor interactions. Supervisors oversee process trees, ensuring restarts on failures, while libcluster enables dynamic node clustering across BEAM VMs on separate machines or Docker containers.\\

Using GenServer for each cell provides isolated state management and handles message-passing between neighbors reliably, ensuring the Game of Life's rules execute fault-tolerantly even under high concurrency. Supervisors maintain process lifecycles across crashes, preserving simulation stability during distributed runs. Libcluster simplifies multi-node deployment on separate VMs or Docker, enabling scalable cell distribution beyond single-machine limits, directly supporting your project's cross-VM requirement.
